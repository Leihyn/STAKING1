# DeFi Staking App - Foundry Project
Overview
Welcome to the DeFi Staking App project! This project is built using Solidity and Foundry and allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards. The project was inspired by the "Code along with Chainlink Labs Lead Developer Advocate Patrick Collins and build your very own DeFi staking app" tutorial.

Features
Staking: Users can stake their tokens into the contract.
Rewards: Users earn rewards over time based on the amount they have staked.
Unstaking: Users can unstake their tokens and withdraw their rewards.
Ownership: The contract includes ownership controls, allowing the owner to set reward rates and manage the contract.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
Foundry (Solidity development environment)
Git (for version control)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/defi-staking-app.git
cd defi-staking-app
Install Foundry:

Follow the instructions on the Foundry website to install Foundry if you haven't already.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
forge install
Compile the contracts:

bash
Copy code
forge build
Deploy the contract:

Deploy the contract to a local network or a testnet (e.g., Sepolia).

bash
Copy code
forge create --rpc-url https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY src/Staking.sol:Staking
Run tests:

bash
Copy code
forge test
Usage
Once deployed, the staking contract allows users to:

Stake tokens by calling the stake() function.
Claim rewards periodically using the claimReward() function.
Unstake tokens and withdraw their staked amount and rewards with the unstake() function.
Example:
solidity
Copy code
contract Staking {
    // Staking contract code
}
